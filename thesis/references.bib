  abstract = {Abstract             Earlier observations in neuroscience suggested that no new neurons form in the mature central nervous system. Evidence now indicates that new neurons do form in the adult mammalian brain. Two regions of the mature mammalian brain generate new neurons: (a) the border of the lateral ventricles of the brain (subventricular zone) and (b) the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This review focuses only on new neuron formation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. During normal prenatal and early postnatal development, neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to differentiated neurons. NSCs persist in the dentate gyrus SGZ, undergoing cell division, with some daughter cells differentiating into functional neurons that participate in learning and memory and general cognition through integration into pre-existing neural networks. Axons, which emanate from neurons in the entorhinal cortex, synapse with dendrites of the granule cells (small neurons) of the dentate gyrus. Axons from granule cells synapse with pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA3 region, which send axons to synapse with CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells that send their axons out of the hippocampus proper. Adult neurogenesis includes proliferation, differentiation, migration, the death of some newly formed cells and final integration of surviving cells into neural networks. We summarise these processes in adult mammalian hippocampal neurogenesis and discuss the roles of major signalling molecules that influence neurogenesis, including neurotransmitters and some hormones. The recent controversy raised concerning whether or not adult neurogenesis occurs in humans also is discussed.},

This review summarizes the recent research regarding the process of adult neurogenesis from these different perspectives, with particular emphasis on the differentiation and development of new neurons, the regulation of the process by extrinsic and intrinsic factors, and their ultimate function in the hippocampus circuit. Arising from a local neural stem cell population, new neurons progress through several stages of maturation, ultimately integrating into the adult dentate gyrus network. The increased appreciation of the full neurogenesis process, from genes and cells to behavior and cognition, makes neurogenesis both a unique case study for how scales in neuroscience can link together and suggests neurogenesis as a potential target for therapeutic intervention for a number of disorders.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In most mammals, new neurons are not only produced during embryogenesis but also after birth. Soon after adult neurogenesis was discovered, the influence of recruiting new neurons on cognitive functions, especially on memory, was documented. Likewise, the late process of neuronal production also contributes to affective functions, but this outcome was recognized with more difficulty. This review covers hypes and hopes of discovering the influence of newly-generated neurons on brain circuits devoted to affective functions. If the possibility of integrating new neurons into the adult brain is a commonly accepted faculty in the realm of mammals, the reluctance is strong when it comes to translating this concept to humans. Compiling data suggest now that new neurons are derived not only from stem cells, but also from a population of neuroblasts displaying a protracted maturation and ready to be engaged in adult brain circuits, under specific signals. Here, we discuss the significance of recruiting new neurons in the adult brain circuits, specifically in the context of affective outcomes. We also discuss the fact that adult neurogenesis could be the ultimate cellular process that integrates elements from both the internal and external environment to adjust brain functions. While we must be critical and beware of the unreal promises that Science could generate sometimes, it is important to continue exploring the potential of neural recruitment in adult primates. Reporting adult neurogenesis in humankind contributes to a new vision of humans as mammals whose brain continues to develop throughout life. This peculiar faculty could one day become the target of treatment for mental health, cognitive disorders, and elderly-associated diseases. The vision of an adult brain which never stops integrating new neurons               is               a real game changer for designing new therapeutic interventions to treat mental disorders associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and social costs.},

The number of labeled cells declined rapidly with increased age at the time of injection. Histological studies showed the presence in young rats of a large germinal matrix of mitotic cells in the ependymal and subependymal layers of the third and lateral ventricles. The areal extent and cell population of this germinal pool declined rapidly from birth on, with a transient rise with a peak at about 15 days. During this latter period the number of ``undifferentiated'' cells near the granular layer of the dentate gyrus showed a rapid rise with a subsequent decline. The decline in the number of ``undifferentiated'' cells was accompanied by a rise in the number of differentiated granule cells. Cell counts in homologous parts of the dentate gyrus indicated a six-fold increase in the number of differentiated granule cells from birth to three months. We postulated that undifferentiated cells migrate postnatally from the forebrain ventricles to the hippocampus where they become differentiated. The possible functional significance of delayed hippocampal neurogenesis is discussed with reference to our finding of incorporation of testosterone-H               3               by cells of the hippocampus, implicating that they may function as receptors of gonadal hormones.},

Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA 1, at a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality (1.7 percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and, in one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia. Under otherwise unchanged conditions the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of 47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a lethality of 18 percent. (Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the recovery rate.) However this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different (complementary) mechanisms of action. Leucocyte counts made after application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1 and with ifosfamide, the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics. In combination with the cited plaque test for BA 1, blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status. Since IF can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the DS carcinosarcoma in rats -- these findings are of special importance. Finally, the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumour-free rats after i.v. application of BA 1. The thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising.},

However, the contribution of CA1 neurons in the human hippocampus to the retrieval of episodic autobiographical memory remains elusive. In patients with a rare acute transient global amnesia, highly focal lesions confined to the CA1 field of the hippocampus can be detected on MRI. We studied the effect of these lesions on autobiographical memory using a detailed autobiographical interview including the remember/know procedure. In 14 of 16 patients, focal lesions in the CA1 sector of the hippocampal cornu ammonis were detected. Autobiographical memory was significantly affected over all time periods, including memory for remote periods. Impairment of episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness exhibited a strong temporal gradient extending 30 to 40 y into the past. These results highlight the distinct and critical role of human hippocampal CA1 neurons in autobiographical memory retrieval and for re-experiencing detailed episodic memories.},

  abstract = {Abstract             For decades, the mammalian hippocampus has been the focus of cellular, anatomical, behavioral, and computational studies aimed at understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying cognition. Long recognized as the brain's seat for learning and memory, a wealth of knowledge has been accumulated on how the hippocampus processes sensory input, builds complex associations between objects, events, and space, and stores this information in the form of memories to be retrieved later in life. However, despite major efforts, our understanding of hippocampal cognitive function remains fragmentary, and models trying to explain it are continually revisited. Here, we review the literature across all above-mentioned domains and offer a new perspective by bringing attention to the most distinctive, and generally neglected, feature of the mammalian hippocampal formation, namely, the structural separability of the two blades of the dentate gyrus into ``supra-pyramidal'' and ``infra-pyramidal''. Next, we discuss recent reports supporting differential effects of adult neurogenesis in the regulation of mature granule cell activity in these two blades. We propose a model for how differences in connectivity and adult neurogenesis in the two blades can potentially provide a substrate for subtly different cognitive functions.},

Here, we show that a high dose of BrdU (300 mg/kg) is a specific, quantitative, and nontoxic marker of dividing cells in the adult rat dentate gyrus, whereas lower doses label only a fraction of the S-phase cells. By using this high dose of BrdU along with a second S-phase marker, [               3               H]thymidine, we found that young adult rats have 9,400 dividing cells proliferating with a cell cycle time of 25 hours, which would generate 9,000 new cells each day, or more than 250,000 per month. Within 5--12 days of BrdU injection, a substantial pool of immature granule neurons, 50\% of all BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus, could be identified with neuron-specific antibodies TuJ1 and TUC-4. This number of new granule neurons generated each month is 6\% of the total size of the granule cell population and 30--60\% of the size of the afferent and efferent populations (West et al. [               1991               ] Anat Rec 231:482--497; Mulders et al. [               1997               ] J Comp Neurol 385:83--94). The large number of the adult-generated granule cells supports the idea that these new neurons play an important role in hippocampal function. J. Comp. Neurol. 435:406--417, 2001.

  abstract = {The brain has computational capabilities that surpass those of modern systems, being able to solve complex problems efficiently in a simple way. Neuromorphic engineering aims to mimic biology in order to develop new systems capable of incorporating such capabilities. Bio-inspired learning systems continue to be a challenge that must be solved, and much work needs to be done in this regard. Among all brain regions, the hippocampus stands out as an autoassociative short-term memory with the capacity to learn and recall memories from any fragment of them. These characteristics make the hippocampus an ideal candidate for developing bio-inspired learning systems that, in addition, resemble content-addressable memories. Therefore, in this work we propose a bio-inspired spiking content-addressable memory model based on the CA3 region of the hippocampus with the ability to learn, forget and recall memories, both orthogonal and non-orthogonal, from any fragment of them. The model was implemented on the SpiNNaker hardware platform using Spiking Neural Networks. A set of experiments based on functional, stress and applicability tests were performed to demonstrate its correct functioning. This work presents the first hardware implementation of a fully-functional bio-inspired spiking hippocampal content-addressable memory model, paving the way for the development of future more complex neuromorphic systems.},

  abstract = {Alternating current impedance measurements have been made over a wide frequency range on the giant axon from the stellar nerve of the squid, Loligo pealii, during the passage of a nerve impulse. The transverse impedance was measured between narrow electrodes on either side of the axon with a Wheatstone bridge having an amplifier and cathode ray oscillograph for detector. When the bridge was balanced, the resting axon gave a narrow line on the oscillograph screen as a sweep circuit moved the spot across. As an impulse passed between impedance electrodes after the axon had been stimulated at one end, the oscillograph line first broadened into a band, indicating a bridge unbalance, and then narrowed down to balance during recovery. From measurements made during the passage of the impulse and appropriate analysis, it was found that the membrane phase angle was unchanged, the membrane capacity decreased about 2 per cent, while the membrane conductance fell from a resting value of 1000 ohm cm.2 to an average of 25 ohm cm.2             The onset of the resistance change occurs somewhat after the start of the monophasic action potential, but coincides quite closely with the point of inflection on the rising phase, where the membrane current reverses in direction, corresponding to a decrease in the membrane electromotive force. This E.M.F. and the conductance are closely associated properties of the membrane, and their sudden changes constitute, or are due to, the activity which is responsible for the all-or-none law and the initiation and propagation of the nerve impulse. These results correspond to those previously found for Nitella and lead us to expect similar phenomena in other nerve fibers.},

In the present study, we evaluated Wistar rats in the WWWhen/ELM task as single setups and in dyads, applying a long retention interval. We also investigated behaviors that could subserve the emergence of this type of memory. We found that only rats tested in the social setting were able to recollect an integrated episodic-like memory that lasted 24 h. Additionally, rats in dyads presented higher levels of exploration during the task. When exposed to the testing environment, the dyads exhibited affiliative behavior toward each other and presented fewer anxiety-like responses. Our findings indicate that the presence of a conspecific could act as a facilitating factor in memory evaluations based on spontaneous exploration of objects and provide empirical support for applying more naturalistic settings in investigations of episodic-like memory in rats.},

  abstract = {We tested a theoretical prediction that patterns of excitatory input activity that consistently fail to activate target neurons sufficiently to induce synaptic potentiation will instead cause a specific synaptic depression. To realize this situation experimentally, the Schaffer collateral projection to area CA1 in rat hippocampal slices was stimulated electrically at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 50 Hz. Nine hundred pulses at 1-3 Hz consistently yielded a depression of the CA1 population excitatory postsynaptic potential that persisted without signs of recovery for greater than 1 hr after cessation of the conditioning stimulation. This long-term depression was specific to the conditioned input, ruling out generalized changes in postsynaptic responsiveness or excitability. Three lines of evidence suggest that this effect is accounted for by a modification of synaptic effectiveness rather than damage to or fatigue of the stimulated inputs. First, the effect was dependent on the stimulation frequency; 900 pulses at 10 Hz caused no lasting change, and at 50 Hz a synaptic potentiation was usually observed. Second, the depressed synapses continued to support long-term potentiation in response to a high-frequency tetanus. Third, the effects of conditioning stimulation could be prevented by application of NMDA receptor antagonists. Thus, our data suggest that synaptic depression can be triggered by prolonged NMDA receptor activation that is below the threshold for inducing synaptic potentiation. We propose that this mechanism is important for the modifications of hippocampal response properties that underlie some forms of learning and memory.},

In adults, using antibodies against the proliferation marker Ki67 and machine learning algorithms, we found proliferating neural progenitor cells.

  abstract = {In the adult hippocampus and olfactory bulb, neural progenitor cells generate neurons that functionally integrate into the existing circuits. To understand how neuronal differentiation occurs in the adult hippocampus, we labeled dividing progenitor cells with a retrovirus expressing green fluorescent protein and studied the morphological and functional properties of their neuronal progeny over the following weeks. During the first week neurons had an irregular shape and immature spikes and were synaptically silent. Slow GABAergic synaptic inputs first appeared during the second week, when neurons exhibited spineless dendrites and migrated into the granule cell layer. In contrast, glutamatergic afferents were detected by the fourth week in neurons displaying mature excitability and morphology. Interestingly, fast GABAergic responses were the latest to appear. It is striking that neuronal maturation in the adult hippocampus follows a precise sequence of connectivity (silent {$\rightarrow$} slow GABA {$\rightarrow$} glutamate {$\rightarrow$} fast GABA) that resembles hippocampal development. We conclude that, unlike what is observed in the olfactory bulb, the hippocampus maintains the same developmental rules for neuronal integration through adulthood.},

The complex [B-L3-23S RNA] was photooxidized in the presence of rose bengal and the modified protein incorporated by reconstitution into 50S ribosomal subunits containing all other unmodified components. Particles containing photooxidized B-L3 are defective in several functional assays, including (1) poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis, (2) peptidyltransferase activity, (3) ability to associate with a [30S-poly(U)-Phe-tRNA] complex, and (4) binding of elongation factor G and GTP. The rates of loss of the partial functional activities during photooxidation of B-L3 indicate that at least two independent inactivating events are occurring, a faster one, involving oxidation of one or more histidine residues, affecting peptidyltransferase and subunit association activities and a slower one affecting EF-G binding. Therefore the protein B-L3 has one or more histidine residues which are essential for peptidyltransferase and subunit association, and another residue which is essential for EF-G-GTP binding. B-L3 may be the ribosomal peptidyltransferase protein, or a part of the active site, and may contribute functional groups to the other active sites as well.},

  abstract = {Sensory experience and learning alter sensory representations in cerebral cortex. The synaptic mechanisms underlying sensory cortical plasticity have long been sought. Recent work indicates that long-term cortical plasticity is a complex, multicomponent process involving multiple synaptic and cellular mechanisms. Sensory use, disuse, and training drive long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), homeostatic synaptic plasticity and plasticity of intrinsic excitability, and structural changes including formation, removal, and morphological remodeling of cortical synapses and dendritic spines. Both excitatory and inhibitory circuits are strongly regulated by experience. This review summarizes these findings and proposes that these mechanisms map onto specific functional components of plasticity, which occur in common across the primary somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices.},

Which neuron model performed the best?           ,                             Opinions strongly diverge on what constitutes a good model of a neuron (                                1                              --                                3                              ). Two lines of thought on this have coexisted for a long time: detailed biophysical models (of the style proposed in 1952 by the physiologists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley) that describe ion channels on the tree-like spatial structure of the neuronal cell (                                4                              ), and simple ``integrate-and-fire'' models based on the much older insight that pulsatile electrical activity (known as an action potential or spike) is a threshold process. Electrophysiologists generally prefer the biophysical models, familiar with the notion of ion channels that open and close (and hence, alter neuronal activity) depending on environmental conditions. Theoreticians, by contrast, typically prefer simple neuron models with few parameters that are amenable to mathematical analysis. Earlier this year, following previous attempts at model comparison on a smaller scale (                                5                              ), the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) launched an international competition (                                6                              ) that allowed a quantitative comparison of neuron models.},

How can we understand information transmission by neurons? What happens if thousands of neurons are coupled together in a seemingly random network?

These questions are addressed in this 2002 introduction to spiking neurons aimed at those taking courses in computational neuroscience, theoretical biology, biophysics, or neural networks. The approach will suit students of physics, mathematics, or computer science; it will also be useful for biologists who are interested in mathematical modelling.

In contrast, the brain learns continuously, and typically learns best when new training is interleaved with periods of sleep for memory consolidation. Here we used spiking network to study mechanisms behind catastrophic forgetting and the role of sleep in preventing it. The network could be trained to learn a complex foraging task but exhibited catastrophic forgetting when trained sequentially on different tasks. In synaptic weight space, new task training moved the synaptic weight configuration away from the manifold representing old task leading to forgetting. Interleaving new task training with periods of off-line reactivation, mimicking biological sleep, mitigated catastrophic forgetting by constraining the network synaptic weight state to the  previously learned manifold, while allowing the weight configuration to converge towards the intersection of the manifolds representing old and new tasks. The study reveals a possible strategy of synaptic weights dynamics the brain applies during sleep to prevent forgetting and optimize learning.},

However, experiments that have suggested a presynaptic component are also summarized. It is argued that the pairing of glutamate uncaging onto single spines with postsynaptic depolarization provides the final and most elegant demonstration of a postsynaptic expression mechanism for NMDA receptor-dependent LTP. The fact that the magnitude of this LTP is similar to that evoked by pairing synaptic stimulation and depolarization leaves little room for a substantial presynaptic component. Finally, recent data also require a revision in our thinking about the way AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are recruited to the postsynaptic density during LTP. This recruitment is independent of subunit type, but does require an adequate reserve pool of extrasynaptic receptors.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Spontaneous synchronization over large networks is ubiquitous in nature, ranging from inanimate to biological systems. In the human brain, neuronal synchronization and de-synchronization occur during sleep, with the greatest degree of neuronal synchronization during slow wave sleep (SWS). The current sleep classification schema is based on electroencephalography and provides common criteria for clinicians and researchers to describe stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep as well as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These sleep stage classifications have been based on convenient heuristic criteria, with little consideration of the accompanying normal physiological changes across those same sleep stages. To begin to resolve those inconsistencies, first focusing only on NREM sleep, we propose a simple cluster synchronization model to explain the emergence of SWS in healthy people without sleep disorders. We apply the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis to quantify slow wave activity in electroencephalograms, and provide quantitative evidence to support our model. Based on this synchronization model, NREM sleep can be classified as SWS and non-SWS, such that NREM sleep can be considered as an intrinsically bistable process. Finally, we develop an automated algorithm for SWS classification. We show that this new approach can unify brain wave dynamics and their corresponding physiologic changes.},

In order to model neuronal behavior or to interpret the results of modeling studies, neuroscientists must call upon methods of nonlinear dynamics. This book offers an introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems theory for researchers and graduate students in neuroscience. It also provides an overview of neuroscience for mathematicians who want to learn the basic facts of electrophysiology.             Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience presents a systematic study of the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and computational properties of neurons. It emphasizes that information processing in the brain depends not only on the electrophysiological properties of neurons but also on their dynamical properties. The book introduces dynamical systems, starting with one- and two-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and continuing to a description of bursting systems. Each chapter proceeds from the simple to the complex, and provides sample problems at the end. The book explains all necessary mathematical concepts using geometrical intuition; it includes many figures and few equations, making it especially suitable for non-mathematicians. Each concept is presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics, providing a link between the two disciplines.             Nonlinear dynamical systems theory is at the core of computational neuroscience research, but it is not a standard part of the graduate neuroscience curriculum---or taught by math or physics department in a way that is suitable for students of biology. This book offers neuroscience students and researchers a comprehensive account of concepts and methods increasingly used in computational neuroscience.

  abstract = {We present a minimal spiking network that can polychronize, that is, exhibit reproducible time-locked but not synchronous firing patterns with millisecond precision, as in synfire braids. The network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP); a ready-to-use MATLAB code is included. It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and STDP, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. We speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (TNGS, neural Darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as ``attention to memories.''},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to optimize the conditions for enhancing the antioxidant properties of sword bean (Canavalia gladiata) as a coffee substitute in two processing methods, roasting and grinding. The optimum conditions for removing off-flavor of the bean and maximizing functionality and efficiency were light roasting and cryogenic grinding ({$<$} 53 {$\mu$}m). In these conditions, extraction yield was 16.75\%, total phenolic content (TPC) was 69.82 {\textpm} 0.35 mg gallic acid equivalents/g, and total flavonoid content (TFC) was 168.81 {\textpm} 1.64 mg quercetin equivalents/100 g. The antioxidant properties were 77.58 {\textpm} 0.27\% for DPPH radical scavenging activity and 58.02 {\textpm} 0.76 mg Trolox equivalents/g for ABTS radical scavenging activity. The values for TFC and ABTS radical scavenging activity were significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.05) than in other conditions, and TPC and DPPH radical scavenging activity were second highest in lightly roasted beans, following raw beans. HS-SPME/GCMS analysis confirmed that the amino acids and carbohydrates, which are the main components of sword bean, were condensed into other volatile flavor compounds, such as derivatives of furan, pyrazine, and pyrrole during roasting. Roasted and cryogenically ground (cryo-ground) sword beans showed higher functionality in terms of TFC, DPPH, and ABTS radical scavenging activities compared to those of coffee. Overall results showed that light roasting and cryogenic grinding are the most suitable processing conditions for enhancing the bioactivity of sword beans.},

In comparison to mature GCs (mGCs) (born during development), the imGCs exhibit two competing distinct properties such as high excitability and low excitatory innervation. We develop a spiking neural network for the DG, incorporating the imGCs, and investigate their effect on pattern separation. We first consider the effect of high excitability. The imGCs become very highly active due to their low firing threshold. Then, strong pattern correlation occurs, which results in pattern integration. On the other hand, the mGCs exhibit very sparse firing activity due to strongly increased feedback inhibition. As a result of high sparsity, the pattern separation efficacy (PSE) of the mGCs becomes very high. Thus, the whole population of GCs becomes a heterogeneous one, composed of a (major) subpopulation of mGCs (i.e., pattern separators) with very low activation degree and a (minor) subpopulation of imGCs (i.e., pattern integrators) with very high activation degree. In the whole heterogeneous population, the overall activation degree of all the GCs is a little reduced in comparison to the activation degree in the presence of only mGCs without imGCs. However, no pattern separation occurs, due to heterogeneous sparsity, in contrast to the usual intuitive thought that sparsity could improve PSE. Next, we consider the effect of low excitatory innervation for the imGCs. In this case, the imGCs perform pattern integration. The PSE of the mGCs decreases from a high value to a limit value. In the whole population of all the GCs, when passing through a threshold, pattern separation starts, the overall PSE increases and approaches that of the mGCs. However, due to heterogeneity caused by the imGCs, the overall PSE becomes deteriorated, in comparison with that in the presence of only mGCs.},

Recent theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that the formation and retrieval of cell assemblies enable these functions. Yet, how cell assemblies are formed and retrieved in a full-scale spiking neural network (SNN) of CA3 that incorporates the observed diversity of neurons and connections within this circuit is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that a data-driven SNN model quantitatively reflecting the neuron type-specific population sizes, intrinsic electrophysiology, connectivity statistics, synaptic signaling, and long-term plasticity of the mouse CA3 is capable of robust auto-association and pattern completion via cell assemblies. Our results show that a broad range of assembly sizes could successfully and systematically retrieve patterns from heavily incomplete or corrupted cues after a limited number of presentations. Furthermore, performance was robust with respect to partial overlap of assemblies through shared cells, substantially enhancing memory capacity. These novel findings provide computational evidence that the specific biological properties of the CA3 circuit produce an effective neural substrate for associative learning in the mammalian brain.},

These opposing mechanisms were driven by extrasynaptic transmission from adult-born neurons directly onto mature granule cells via metabotropic glutamate receptors or               N               -methyl-               D               -aspartate receptors, respectively. The balance between these mechanisms could explain the differences in dentate gyrus activity during two versions of an active place-avoidance task. The action of adult-born neurons thus depended entirely on the demands of the environment, which can be defined by the activity of cortical and subcortical regions sending inputs to the dentate gyrus.                                         Science               , this issue p.               578               ; see also p.               530                        ,              Depending on the origin of the incoming connections, dentate gyrus neurogenesis can directly inhibit or excite mature granule cells.           ,                             Young adult-born granule cells (abGCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) have a profound impact on cognition and mood. However, it remains unclear how abGCs distinctively contribute to local DG information processing. We found that the actions of abGCs in the DG depend on the origin of incoming afferents. In response to lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) inputs, abGCs exert monosynaptic inhibition of mature granule cells (mGCs) through group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. By contrast, in response to medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) inputs, abGCs directly excite mGCs through               N               -methyl-               d               -aspartate receptors. Thus, a critical function of abGCs may be to regulate the relative synaptic strengths of LEC-driven contextual information versus MEC-driven spatial information to shape distinct neural representations in the DG.},

This ``sense of direction'' appears to involve the integration of angular velocity signals that arise primarily in the vestibular system. A hypothesis is proposed in which the integration process, an operation that may be difficult for neurons to implement, is replaced by a linear associative mapping, an operation that is at least theoretically easy to implement with neurons. The proposed system makes use of a set of linearly independent vectors representing the combination of the current head direction, and head angular velocity representations to ``recall'' the resulting head direction. It is then proposed that visual landmarks become incorporated into the directional system, enabling both the correction of cumulative error and, ultimately, the computation of novel, optimal trajectories between locations. According to the hypothesis, this occurs through the association of hippo-campal ``local-view'' cells (i.e., direction selective ``place cells'') with ``head-direction'' cells located downstream in the dorsal presubiculum. The possible neurophysiological and neuroan-atomical bases for the proposed system are discussed.},

However, limited experimental yield, heterogeneous recordings conditions, and ambiguous neuronal identification have so far prevented the consistent characterization of synaptic signals for all connections of any neural system. We introduce a strategy to overcome these challenges and report a comprehensive synaptic quantification among all known neuron types of the hippocampal-entorhinal network. First, we reconstructed {$>$}2600 synaptic traces from {$\sim$}1200 publications into a unified computational representation of synaptic dynamics. We then trained a deep learning architecture with the resulting parameters, each annotated with detailed metadata such as recording method, solutions, and temperature. The model learned to predict the synaptic properties of all 3,120 circuit connections in arbitrary conditions with accuracy approaching the intrinsic experimental variability. Analysis of data normalized and completed with the deep learning model revealed that synaptic signals are controlled by few latent variables associated with specific molecular markers and interrelating conductance, decay time constant, and short-term plasticity. We freely release the tools and full dataset of unitary synaptic values in 32 covariate settings. Normalized synaptic data can be used in brain simulations, and to predict and test experimental hypothesis.},

The latter assumption derives partly from the anatomical and physiological properties of DG. However, the major output of DG is from a large number of DG granule cells to a smaller number of CA3 pyramidal cells, which potentially negates the pattern separation performed in the DG. Here, we consider a simple CA3 network model, and consider how it might interact with a previously developed computational model of the DG. The resulting ``standard'' DG-CA3 model performs pattern storage and completion well, given a small set of sparse, randomly derived patterns representing entorhinal input to the DG and CA3. However, under many circumstances, the pattern separation achieved in the DG is not as robust in CA3, resulting in a low storage capacity for CA3, compared to previous mathematical estimates of the storage capacity for an autoassociative network of this size. We also examine an often-overlooked aspect of hippocampal anatomy that might increase functionality in the combined DG-CA3 model. Specifically, axon collaterals of CA3 pyramidal cells project ``back'' to the DG (``backprojections''), exerting inhibitory effects on granule cells that could potentially ensure that different subpopulations of granule cells are recruited to respond to similar patterns. In the model, addition of such backprojections improves both pattern separation and storage capacity.

Prior models of the dentate gyrus have generally fallen into two categories: simplified models that have focused on a single granule cell layer and its ability to perform pattern separation, and large-scale and biophysically realistic models of dentate gyrus, which include hilar cells, but which have not specifically addressed pattern separation. The present model begins to bridge this gap. The model includes two of the major subtypes of hilar cells: excitatory hilar mossy cells and inhibitory hilar interneurons that receive input from and project to the perforant path terminal zone (HIPP cells). In the model, mossy cells and HIPP cells provide a mechanism for dynamic regulation of pattern separation, allowing the system to upregulate and downregulate pattern separation in response to environmental and task demands. Specifically, pattern separation in the model can be strongly decreased by decreasing mossy cell function and/or by increasing HIPP cell function; pattern separation can be increased by the opposite manipulations. We propose that hilar cells may similarly mediate dynamic regulation of pattern separation in the dentate gyrus in vivo, not only because of their connectivity within the dentate gyrus, but also because of their modulation by brainstem inputs and by the axons that ``backproject'' from area CA3 pyramidal cells. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Previously, neuronal mechanisms underlying various cognitive functions are delineated with the lamellar hippocampal circuitry, dentate gyrus---CA3 or CA2---CA1, within the transverse plane. More recently, interlamellar (often referred to as longitudinal) projections have received intensive attention to help understand signal convergence and divergence in cognition and behavior. Signal propagation along the longitudinal axis is evidenced by axonal arborization patterns and synaptic responses to electro- and photo-stimulation, further demonstrating that information flow is more enriched in the longitudinal plane than the transverse plane. Here, we review the significance of longitudinal connections for cognition, discuss a putative circuit mechanism of place coding, and suggest the reconceptualization of the hippocampal circuitry.},

  abstract = {The combination of spiking neural networks and event-based vision sensors holds the potential of highly efficient and high-bandwidth optical flow estimation. This paper presents the first hierarchical spiking architecture in which motion (direction and speed) selectivity emerges in an unsupervised fashion from the raw stimuli generated with an event-based camera. A novel adaptive neuron model and stable spike-timing-dependent plasticity formulation are at the core of this neural network governing its spike-based processing and learning, respectively. After convergence, the neural architecture exhibits the main properties of biological visual motion systems, namely feature extraction and local and global motion perception. Convolutional layers with input synapses characterized by single and multiple transmission delays are employed for feature and local motion perception, respectively; while global motion selectivity emerges in a final fully-connected layer. The proposed solution is validated using synthetic and real event sequences. Along with this paper, we provide the cuSNN library, a framework that enables GPU-accelerated simulations of large-scale spiking neural networks.

  abstract = {Spindles are ubiquitous oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. A growing body of evidence points to a possible link with learning and memory, and the underlying mechanisms are now starting to be unveiled. Specifically, spindles are associated with increased dendritic activity and high intracellular calcium levels, a situation favourable to plasticity, as well as with control of spiking output by feed-forward inhibition. During spindles, thalamocortical networks become unresponsive to inputs, thus potentially preventing interference between memory-related internal information processing and extrinsic signals. At the system level, spindles are co-modulated with other major NREM oscillations, including hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) and neocortical slow waves, both previously shown to be associated with learning and memory. The sequential occurrence of reactivation at the time of SWRs followed by neuronal plasticity-promoting spindles is a possible mechanism to explain NREM sleep-dependent consolidation of memories.

Therefore, standard STDP models have expressed the weight change as a function of pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic spike. Unfortunately, those paired-based STDP models cannot account for the dependence on the repetition frequency of the pairs of spike. Moreover, those STDP models cannot reproduce recent triplet and quadruplet experiments. Here, we examine a triplet rule (i.e., a rule which considers sets of three spikes, i.e., two pre and one post or one pre and two post) and compare it to classical pair-based STDP learning rules. With such a triplet rule, it is possible to fit experimental data from visual cortical slices as well as from hippocampal cultures. Moreover, when assuming stochastic spike trains, the triplet learning rule can be mapped to a Bienenstock--Cooper--Munro learning rule.},

This paradigm has also been adopted by the theory of artificial neural networks. Recent physiological experiments demonstrate, however, that in many parts of the nervous system, neural code is founded on the timing of individual action potentials. This finding has given rise to the emergence of a new class of neural models, called spiking neural networks. In this paper we summarize basic properties of spiking neurons and spiking networks. Our focus is, specifically, on models of spike-based information coding, synaptic plasticity and learning. We also survey real-life applications of spiking models. The paper is meant to be an introduction to spiking neural networks for scientists from various disciplines interested in spike-based neural processing.},

During consolidation, memories are stabilized against future interference and undergo qualitative changes with regard to their ``explicitness'' and underlying neural representation. In this article, we argue that declarative memory consolidation during sleep is based on covert reactivations of newly encoded memory traces in the hippocampus. During slow-wave sleep (SWS), the prominent slow oscillations act to synchronize the repeated reactivation of the newly encoded representations in hippocampal networks with the generation of spindle activity in the thalamus, supporting changes in neocortical networks that contribute to long-term memory storage. In this view, sleep plays an active role in the consolidation of memories, in which the neuronal reactivation of newly acquired memories is critical for the redistribution and integration of these memories into the network of pre-existing long-term memories.},

This technique was first described in 1937 and later adapted 3 times: first, in 1957, after the detection of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when electrooculography (EOG) was added; second, in 1968, when sleep staging was standardized and electromyography (EMG) was added; and third, in 2007, to integrate accumulated knowledge from sleep science, adding arousals and respiratory, cardiac, and movement events. In spite of the dramatic changes that have taken place in recording and storing techniques, sleep staging has undergone surprisingly few changes. The argument of the present comment is that sleep staging was appropriate as long as sleep biosignals were recorded in the analog mode as curves on paper, whereas this staging may be insufficient for digitally recorded and stored sleep data. Limitations of sleep staging are critically discussed and alternative strategies of sleep analysis are emphasized.},

  abstract = {The precise times of occurrence of individual pre- and postsynaptic action potentials are known to play a key role in the modification of synaptic efficacy. Based on stimulation protocols of two synaptically connected neurons, we infer an algorithm that reproduces the experimental data by modifying the probability of vesicle discharge as a function of the relative timing of spikes in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. The primary feature of this algorithm is an asymmetry with respect to the direction of synaptic modification depending on whether the presynaptic spikes precede or follow the postsynaptic spike. Specifically, if the presynaptic spike occurs up to 50 ms before the postsynaptic spike, the probability of vesicle discharge is upregulated, while the probability of vesicle discharge is downregulated if the presynaptic spike occurs up to 50 ms after the postsynaptic spike. When neurons fire irregularly with Poisson spike trains at constant mean firing rates, the probability of vesicle discharge converges toward a characteristic value determined by the preand postsynaptic firing rates. On the other hand, if the mean rates of the Poisson spike trains slowly change with time, our algorithm predicts modifications in the probability of release that generalize Hebbian and Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rules. We conclude that the proposed spike- based synaptic learning algorithm provides a general framework for regulating neurotransmitter release probability.},

Advances in the ensuing 28 years warranted a re-look at visual scoring of sleep stages. This paper describes the work of the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force, including methodology, a literature review and the rationale behind the new rules. Reliability studies of R \& K scoring were reviewed; reliability was low for stage one and moderate for slow wave sleep. Evidence indicated that K complexes and slow waves are expressed maximal frontally, spindles centrally and alpha rhythm over the occipital region. Three derivations of EEG, two of electro-oculography, and one of chin EMG were recommended. Scoring by 30-second epochs was retained. New terminology for sleep stages was proposed. Attenuation of alpha rhythm was determined to be the most valid electrophysiological marker of sleep onset. Alternative measures were proposed for non-alpha generating subjects. K complexes associated with arousals were determined to be insufficient alone to define the new stage N2. No evidence was found to justify dividing slow wave sleep into two stages. No reasons were found to alter the current slow wave amplitude criteria at any age. The phenomena of REM sleep were defined. The rules for defining onset and termination of REM sleep periods were simplified. Movement time was eliminated and major body movements defined. Studies are needed to test the reliability of the new rules. Future advances in technology may require modification of these rules with time.},

Highlighted in the text is the contribution of Brazilian medievalists by presenting a new perspective, the perspective of the 'other' towards European historiography, and the importance of critical divulgation and the renewal of historical knowledge.},

  abstract = {Backpropagation (BP) has been the most successful algorithm used to train artificial neural networks. However, there are several gaps between BP and learning in biologically plausible neuronal networks of the brain (learning in the brain, or simply BL, for short), in particular, (1) it has been unclear to date, if BP can be implemented exactly via BL, (2) there is a lack of local plasticity in BP, i.e., weight updates require information that is not locally available, while BL utilizes only locally available information, and (3) there is a lack of autonomy in BP, i.e., some external control over the neural network is required (e.g., switching between prediction and learning stages requires changes to dynamics and synaptic plasticity rules), while BL works fully autonomously. Bridging such gaps, i.e., understanding how BP can be approximated by BL, has been of major interest in both neuroscience and machine learning. Despite tremendous efforts, however, no previous model has bridged the gaps at a degree of demonstrating an equivalence to BP, instead, only approximations to BP have been shown. Here, we present for the first time a framework within BL that bridges the above crucial gaps. We propose a BL model that (1) produces exactly the same updates of the neural weights as BP, while (2) employing local plasticity, i.e., all neurons perform only local computations, done simultaneously. We then modify it to an alternative BL model that (3) also works fully autonomously. Overall, our work provides important evidence for the debate on the long-disputed question whether the brain can perform BP.},

  abstract = {Brian 2 allows scientists to simply and efficiently simulate spiking neural network models. These models can feature novel dynamical equations, their interactions with the environment, and experimental protocols. To preserve high performance when defining new models, most simulators offer two options: low-level programming or description languages. The first option requires expertise, is prone to errors, and is problematic for reproducibility. The second option cannot describe all aspects of a computational experiment, such as the potentially complex logic of a stimulation protocol. Brian addresses these issues using runtime code generation. Scientists write code with simple and concise high-level descriptions, and Brian transforms them into efficient low-level code that can run interleaved with their code. We illustrate this with several challenging examples: a plastic model of the pyloric network, a closed-loop sensorimotor model, a programmatic exploration of a neuron model, and an auditory model with real-time input.           ,              Simulating the brain starts with understanding the activity of a single neuron. From there, it quickly gets very complicated. To reconstruct the brain with computers, neuroscientists have to first understand how one brain cell communicates with another using electrical and chemical signals, and then describe these events using code. At this point, neuroscientists can begin to build digital copies of complex neural networks to learn more about how those networks interpret and process information.             To do this, computational neuroscientists have developed simulators that take models for how the brain works to simulate neural networks. These simulators need to be able to express many different models, simulate these models accurately, and be relatively easy to use. Unfortunately, simulators that can express a wide range of models tend to require technical expertise from users, or perform poorly; while those capable of simulating models efficiently can only do so for a limited number of models. An approach to increase the range of models simulators can express is to use so-called `model description languages'. These languages describe each element within a model and the relationships between them, but only among a limited set of possibilities, which does not include the environment. This is a problem when attempting to simulate the brain, because a brain is precisely supposed to interact with the outside world.             Stimberg et al. set out to develop a simulator that allows neuroscientists to express several neural models in a simple way, while preserving high performance, without using model description languages. Instead of describing each element within a specific model, the simulator generates code derived from equations provided in the model. This code is then inserted into the computational experiments. This means that the simulator generates code specific to each model, allowing it to perform well across a range of models. The result, Brian 2, is a neural simulator designed to overcome the rigidity of other simulators while maintaining performance.             Stimberg et al. illustrate the performance of Brian 2 with a series of computational experiments, showing how Brian 2 can test unconventional models, and demonstrating how users can extend the code to use Brian 2 beyond its built-in capabilities.},

To facilitate construction of system models with multiple cell types, we generate a database of point models associated with the Allen Cell Types Database. We construct a set of generalized leaky integrate-and-fire (GLIF) models of increasing complexity to reproduce the spiking behaviors of 645 recorded neurons from 16 transgenic lines. The more complex models have an increased capacity to predict spiking behavior of hold-out stimuli. We use unsupervised methods to classify cell types, and find that high level GLIF model parameters are able to differentiate transgenic lines comparable to electrophysiological features. The more complex model parameters also have an increased ability to differentiate between transgenic lines. Thus, creating simple models is an effective dimensionality reduction technique that enables the differentiation of cell types from electrophysiological responses without the need for a priori-defined features. This database will provide a set of simplified models of multiple cell types for the community to use in network models.},

  abstract = {We investigate a recently proposed model for cortical computation which performs relational inference. It consists of several interconnected, structurally equivalent populations of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, which are trained in a self-organized fashion with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Despite its robust learning dynamics, the model is susceptible to a problem typical for recurrent networks which use a correlation based (Hebbian) learning rule: if trained with high learning rates, the recurrent connections can cause strong feedback loops in the network dynamics, which lead to the emergence of attractor states. This causes a strong reduction in the number of representable patterns and a decay in the inference ability of the network. As a solution, we introduce a conceptually very simple "wake-sleep" algorithm: during the wake phase, training is executed normally, while during the sleep phase, the network "dreams" samples from its generative model, which are induced by random input. This process allows us to activate the attractor states in the network, which can then be unlearned effectively by an anti-Hebbian mechanism. The algorithm allows us to increase learning rates up to a factor of ten while avoiding clustering, which allows the network to learn several times faster. Also for low learning rates, where clustering is not an issue, it improves convergence speed and reduces the final inference error.},

Interpyramidal synapses in layer V exhibit fast depression of synaptic transmission, while other types of synapses exhibit facilitation of transmission. To study the role of dynamic synapses in network computation, we propose a unified phenomenological model that allows computation of the postsynaptic current generated by both types of synapses when driven by an arbitrary pattern of action potential (AP) activity in a presynaptic population. Using this formalism, we analyze different regimes of synaptic transmission and demonstrate that dynamic synapses transmit different aspects of the presynaptic activity depending on the average presynaptic frequency. The model also allows for derivation of mean-field equations, which govern the activity of large, interconnected networks. We show that the dynamics of synaptic transmission results in complex sets of regular and irregular regimes of network activity.},

The notion of episodic memory was first proposed some 30 years ago. At that time it was defined in terms of materials and tasks. It was subsequently refined and elaborated in terms of ideas such as self, subjective time, and autonoetic consciousness. This chapter provides a brief history of the concept of episodic memory, describes how it has changed (indeed greatly changed) since its inception, considers criticisms of it, and then discusses supporting evidence provided by (a) neuropsychological studies of patterns of memory impairment caused by brain damage, and (b) functional neuroimaging studies of patterns of brain activity of normal subjects engaged in various memory tasks. I also suggest that episodic memory is a true, even if as yet generally unappreciated, marvel of nature.},

A partir destas reflex{\~o}es, concluo que a tentativa de enquadrar espa{\c c}os africanos na cronologia de uma Idade M{\'e}dia atua como uma forma de exporta{\c c}{\~a}o de um Medievalismo Acad{\^e}mico: a {\'A}frica ao Sul do Saara se torna, mais do que um objeto de an{\'a}lise, um campo de cria{\c c}{\~a}o de imagens idealizadas, romantizadas e instrumentalizadas com implica{\c c}{\~o}es epistemol{\'o}gicas e pol{\'i}ticas para a compreens{\~a}o hist{\'o}rica do continente. Portanto, o termo ``{\'A}frica Medieval'' n{\~a}o {\'e} neutro e precisa ser constantemente repensado e problematizado.},

Over the past decade, a large body of work, spanning most of the neurosciences, has provided a substantive body of evidence supporting this role of sleep in what is becoming known as sleep-dependent memory processing. We review these findings, focusing specifically on the role of sleep in (a) memory encoding, (b) memory consolidation, (c) brain plasticity, and (d) memory reconsolidation; we finish with a summary of the field and its potential future directions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A stereological method for obtaining estimates of the total number of neurons in five major subdivisions of the rat hippocampus is described. The new method, the optical fractionator, combines two recent developments in stereology: a three-dimensional probe for counting neuronal nuclei, the optical disector, and a systematic uniform sampling scheme, the fractionator. The optical disector results in unbiased estimates of neuron number, i.e., estimates that are free of assumptions about neuron size and shape, are unaffected by lost caps and over-projection, and approach the true number of neurons in an unlimited manner as the number of samples is increased. The fractionator involves sampling a known fraction of a structural component. In the case of neuron number, a zero dimensional quantity, it provides estimates that are unaffected by shrinkage before, during, and after processing of the tissue. Because the fractionator involves systematic sampling, it also results in highly efficient estimates. Typically only 100--200 neurons must be counted in an animal to obtain a precision that is compatible with experimental studies. The methodology is compared with those used in earlier works involving estimates of neuron number in the rat hippocampus and a number of new stereological methods that have particular relevance to the quantitative study of the structure of the nervous system are briefly described in an appendix.},

Hippocampome.org v1.0 established a foundational classification system identifying 122 hippocampal neuron types based on their axonal and dendritic morphologies, main neurotransmitter, membrane biophysics, and molecular expression. Releases v1.1 through v1.12 furthered the aggregation of literature-mined data, including among others neuron counts, spiking patterns, synaptic physiology, in vivo firing phases, and connection probabilities. Those additional properties increased the online information content of this public resource over 100-fold, enabling numerous independent discoveries by the scientific community. Hippocampome.org v2.0, introduced here, incorporates over 50 new neuron types and extends the functionality to build real-scale, biologically detailed, data-driven computational simulations. In all cases, the freely downloadable model parameters are directly linked to the specific peer-reviewed empirical evidence from which they were derived. Possible research applications include quantitative, multiscale analyses of circuit connectivity and spiking neural network simulations of activity dynamics. These advances can help generate precise, experimentally testable hypotheses and shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying associative memory and spatial navigation.},

  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the great success of deep neural networks in various domains. However, deep neural networks are very resource-intensive in terms of energy consumption, data requirements, and high computational costs. With the recent increasing need for the autonomy of machines in the real world, e.g., self-driving vehicles, drones, and collaborative robots, exploitation of deep neural networks in those applications has been actively investigated. In those applications, energy and computational efficiencies are especially important because of the need for real-time responses and the limited energy supply. A promising solution to these previously infeasible applications has recently been given by biologically plausible spiking neural networks. Spiking neural networks aim to bridge the gap between neuroscience and machine learning, using biologically realistic models of neurons to carry out the computation. Due to their functional similarity to the biological neural network, spiking neural networks can embrace the sparsity found in biology and are highly compatible with temporal code. Our contributions in this work are: (i) we give a comprehensive review of theories of biological neurons; (ii) we present various existing spike-based neuron models, which have been studied in neuroscience; (iii) we detail synapse models; (iv) we provide a review of artificial neural networks; (v) we provide detailed guidance on how to train spike-based neuron models; (vi) we revise available spike-based neuron frameworks that have been developed to support implementing spiking neural networks; (vii) finally, we cover existing spiking neural network applications in computer vision and robotics domains. The paper concludes with discussions of future perspectives.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract{\enspace} Synaptic transmission is a dynamic process. Postsynaptic responses wax and wane as presynaptic activity evolves. This prominent characteristic of chemical synaptic transmission is a crucial determinant of the response properties of synapses and, in turn, of the stimulus properties selected by neural networks and of the patterns of activity generated by those networks. This review focuses on synaptic changes that result from prior activity in the synapse under study, and is restricted to short-term effects that last for at most a few minutes. Forms of synaptic enhancement, such as facilitation, augmentation, and post-tetanic potentiation, are usually attributed to effects of a residual elevation in presynaptic [Ca               2+               ]               i               , acting on one or more molecular targets that appear to be distinct from the secretory trigger responsible for fast exocytosis and phasic release of transmitter to single action potentials. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis, and the origins of the different kinetic phases of synaptic enhancement, as well as the interpretation of statistical changes in transmitter release and roles played by other factors such as alterations in presynaptic Ca               2+               influx or postsynaptic levels of [Ca               2+               ]               i               . Synaptic depression dominates enhancement at many synapses. Depression is usually attributed to depletion of some pool of readily releasable vesicles, and various forms of the depletion model are discussed. Depression can also arise from feedback activation of presynaptic receptors and from postsynaptic processes such as receptor desensitization. In addition, glial-neuronal interactions can contribute to short-term synaptic plasticity. Finally, we summarize the recent literature on putative molecular players in synaptic plasticity and the effects of genetic manipulations and other modulatory influences.},
